# liri-node-app

For this app, you are able to look up a movie and find out it's ratings, small plot summary, languages, etc., an artist and find out their concert listings, where the concerts are located, and what time they are, or a song and find out the artist(s), the song's title, a link to a preview of the song, and the album the song is on.

From here, the user can type in node liri.js followed by either movie-this, concert-this, spotify-this-song, or do-what-it-says with an input following any of the first three commands. (The do-what-it-says command will return the song info for "I Want It That Way")

Depending on the command given, the liri app will return specified information pertaining to the command and following input.

An example of the movie-this command followed by the input Up is as follows:
